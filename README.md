# Chinmay Kale â€” Portfolio v1

Hi, I'm **Chinmay Kale**, an aspiring **Data Scientist & AI Engineer** passionate about using data and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. I created this portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and journey in the field of Data Science.

This site was also a hands-on opportunity for me to dive deeper into web technologies like **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**, which Iâ€™ve used to bring clean visuals and smooth user experience to life.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

While building this portfolio, I enhanced my understanding of:
- Component-based design using **React & Next.js**
- Animations with **Framer Motion**
- Clean UI structuring using **Tailwind CSS**
- Building and structuring a responsive personal brand online

I hope my code helps other beginners in data or tech to start building and customizing their own portfolios too!
